// TODO:
// unsafe is superset of safe: adds on unsafe superpowers
// sound programs: no UB, is correct
// safe programs: subset of all sound programs, since compiler might reject some sound programs (compiler guarantees soundness though)
// unsafe programs: can be sound or unsound, depends on programmer instead of compiler; keep potentially unsound code in marked regions
// safe abstractions over unsafe implementations
// unsafe functions vs unsafe blocks: unfortunate naming, different meaning: blocks: "let me call unsafe functions in here", function: "mark this function as unsafe"
// 5 unsafe superpowers:
// 1. dereference raw pointers
// 2. call unsafe functions
// 3. implement unsafe traits
// 4. read/write a mutable global variable
// 5. reading from a field of a union (untagged enum: enum that doesn't know which value it is) is unsafe (surprisingly, writing is safe)
// make unsafe blocks as small as possible
